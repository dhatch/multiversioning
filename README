Warning: This is still a work in progress.

Library dependencies:

The project links with the cityhash and libnuma libraries. The source
for each dependency can be respectively found at:

https://github.com/google/cityhash.git
https://github.com/numactl/numactl.git

The resulting libraries and header files must be installed in the
libs/ directory. Pass --prefix=$(MV_DIR)/libs/ while configuring the
libraries so that they're installed in the right location.
